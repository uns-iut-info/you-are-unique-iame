STORY : 
"You live in the magnificent realm of Balland.
Since childhood, you've always been laughed by the other ballizens !
For you are a very special being.
Contrary to your peers, you were born different. Unique.
For an unknow reason, some strange particles are emitted by your body and have been given you special abilities.
You used to be ashamed of your difference. But that was before. Before Megaball invided CityBall!
Thanks to your special abilities, try to save the kidnapped ballizens and defeat the awful Megaball !
Hurry ! Everyone's counting on you Superball !" 


EXPLANATION :
The purpose of the game is to collect  in a limited amount of time. 
(A user can set the amount of time as well as the number of balls he needs to save to win the game.)

To do so, the player should try to collid with as many as possible colorful balls. Combos make your ball go faster while colliding with dark balls make you lose you speed and a lifepoint !
The dark balls are underlings sent by Megaball to stop you ! Beware of them !

( A piece of advise : in order to avoid enemies, your can always jump ðŸ˜‰ )

The user can replay as much as he wants to !

LEVELS AND THEIR SPECIFICATIONS :
- LEVEL 1 : it is an easy level. By pressing space, the ball can jump. The enemies are moving randomly and if you touch one them you will lose a life point !
- LEVEL 2 :  it is a more difficult level in which a special enemy appears, a mystery box that will try to follow you if you stand too close to it! It will make you lose 2 balls that you already saved (you will need to save this ball again). After colliding with you, this box wil teleport itself somewhere else in the world. 
- LEVEL 3 : it is the final stage. You will be fighting directly against the awful megaball ! You must throw at him as many balls as possible to exhaust him (by pressing enter). Beware, for each collision with megaball, you will lose a life point !
- As you have a limited amount of time to finish the level, there are teleportation gates that will help you seek for balls in distress faster ! There are also bonuses that will give you a lifepoint when there is a collision with yout ball !
